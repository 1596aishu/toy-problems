LRU cache works as of removing the least recently used page. 
Here I used, a fixed size of cache, and as of the pages got added, the LRU page was deleted if it exceed the capacity of the cache.
I faced problems for testing the code and linking the main code with test cases. 
I faced a problem while storing the count of the number of times each page was occurring.
Hence I removed an extra data structure that I used for that purpose.
